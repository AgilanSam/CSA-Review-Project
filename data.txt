"The major start of all the magic! Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited... This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"

"Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book. I enjoyed this movie immensely... What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own."

"Better Than Anticipated. Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids... A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema."

"There's nothing like the first. The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world... If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie."
